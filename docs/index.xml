      <description>I am currently working on a new project and wanted to add a display. After searching for some decent (and cheap) displays I ordered myself a SSD1306 (specifically this one).
        SSD1306 7 PIN (SPI)    This specific display comes with SPI enabled by default (and we can set it up for I2C if we want). Since I had a pretty hard time trying setting it up with ESP-IDF, I figured I would share what I did.</description>

      <description>I recently switched to Alacritty on my laptop and wanted to share how to get it up and running. Alacritty, much like kitty and wezterm, is a GPU accelerated terminal emulator. It is also the lightest and the fastest among the three and it plays well with TMUX which is a must for me.
        Screenshot of my terminal    Install Steps Alacritty is not in APT so we can&amp;rsquo;t simply do apt install alacritty.</description>

      <title>My Linux Journey</title>

      <description>I have been a long time linux user (10+ years). My fascination with linux began in 11th grade when I stumbled upon the Github Student Developer Pack. I was already interested in programming by then but this gave me access to a whole new world. And ofcourse, a VPS was one of them. Oh boy was I excited! I spent the better part of my winter vacation trying to figure out how to work a SSH client (PuTTY), set up a simple web server (Wordpress with the LAMP Stack) and so on.</description>
