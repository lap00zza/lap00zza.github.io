      <description>I have been a long time linux user (10+ years). My fascination with linux began in 11th grade when I stumbled upon the Github Student Developer Pack. I was already interested in programming by then but this gave me access to a whole new world. And ofcourse, a VPS was one of them. Oh boy was I excited! I spent the better part of my winter vacation trying to figure out how to work a SSH client (PuTTY), set up a simple web server (Wordpress with the LAMP Stack) and so on.</description>
