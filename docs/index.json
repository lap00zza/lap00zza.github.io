[{"content":"\u003cp\u003eI have been a long time linux user (10+ years). My fascination with linux began in 11th grade when I stumbled upon the \u003ca href=\"https://education.github.com/pack\"\u003eGithub Student Developer Pack\u003c/a\u003e. I was already interested in programming by then but this gave me access to a whole new world. And ofcourse, a VPS was one of them. Oh boy was I excited! I spent the better part of my winter vacation trying to figure out how to work a SSH client (PuTTY), set up a simple web server (Wordpress with the LAMP Stack) and so on. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t until I started using Discord (yeah the popular chat platform) that I truly started understanding a lot of the inner workings. I worked day and night on getting my chat bot working, adding new features. This forced me to learn a lot of new things like -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003egit (to keep track of changes)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003epython3 (for the bot)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003epostgresql (database)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003esimple bash programming (to keep the bot up and running + some maintenance)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ehtml/css/js (for the bots frontend)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003enginx\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoon, 50-60k+ people were using it. You get the idea! The early days of discord bots were truly the golden age.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEnough talk about the past! What I wanted to get to was, even though I was using linux quite a bit, it was always limited to server use only. I think I was afraid to switch to linux on my laptop (from Windows) because it was what I was familiar with and did everything that I wanted. Also, gaming was an issue (luckily not anymore). I finally decided to take the plunge for a few reasons:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWindows 10 will stop being supported in 2025 (main reason) and my laptop can\u0026rsquo;t run Windows 11 (no TPM).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFor some reason my bluetooth stopped working properly\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIt was a major pain to get my services running in my LAN (networking issues)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eStartup time was bad. It would take atleast 3-4 mins to get to a useable state.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSleep didn\u0026rsquo;t work. It would keep crashing my laptop on wakeup.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah I know most of this can be addressed just by upgrading to a better laptop. While that is true, I just didn\u0026rsquo;t find it in me to let go of my current laptop. It has been my learning partner over the years and its still going strong. And so I made the decision to switch over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLinux is not a single OS. There are a lot of variations (called \u0026ldquo;distros\u0026rdquo;). I wanted one that was-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003esimilar to Windows in look and feel\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ewas straightforward to use\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shortlisted two - Ubuntu (which I have used in my server for a very long time) and Mint. After some reading, I decided to go with \u003ca href=\"https://www.linuxmint.com/edition.php?id=311\"\u003eLinux Mint Cinammon\u003c/a\u003e. It\u0026rsquo;s been a week since and I am sitting here wondering why did I not switch sooner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/my_desktop.png\" alt=\"\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n","description":null,"image":null,"permalink":"https://lap00zza.github.io/blog/linux_journey/","title":"My Linux Journey"}]
